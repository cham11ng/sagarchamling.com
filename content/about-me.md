## Journey üöÄ

My career in software development began at **[Technorio Inc.](https://technorio.com/)**, a company co-founded by my college friends. As a core team member, I worked as a _Software Engineer_ and team lead, actively contributing to web application projects, leading architectural decision-making, and mentoring fellow developers. Then, my journey led me to **DoranSoft Pvt. Ltd.** as a _Full Stack Developer_, where I leveraged technologies like `Laravel Framework`, `Vue.js`, `jQuery`, and `PostgreSQL` for web application development.

At **[Leapfrog Technology Inc.](https://www.lftechnology.com/)** to **[Laudio](https://www.laudio.com/)**, I wore multiple hats. I started as a _Software Engineer Intern_ at Leapfrog Technology, where I built a strong foundation in UI/UX front-end design and coding practices in Javascript. I then embarked on an exciting journey as a _Software Engineer_ at a project named Laudio, where I familiarized myself with microservices architecture, integrated automated CI processes in development workflow and continued building a Web application based on `React` and `Node.js`.

Subsequently, I progressed to a _Senior Software Engineer_, leading a team and contributing to system design, research and implementation. During this phase of my career, I had the opportunity to work on several cloud-based solutions for the application using `Amazon Web Services (AWS)` and `Microsoft Azure`.

I recently embarked my professional journey in this field starting a _SecOps_ role in **[Fusion Computing Limited](https://fusioncomputing.ca/)**. Started exciting journey of my interest on securing the world.

## Always Learning üéØ

<!-- Constantly seeking to expand my knowledge base, I recently completed a Postgraduate Diploma in Cybersecurity and actively pursue training in emerging technologies. -->
