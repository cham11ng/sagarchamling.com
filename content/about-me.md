## Intro üôè

Welcome to my website! I'm a full stack developer with over 6 years of professional experience in information technology. With a strong foundation in software engineering and programming paradigms, I'm proficient in a wide range of programming languages and platforms. With a diverse journey in the software industry, I've had the privilege of working on exciting projects and honing my skills.

My expertise spans both front-end and back-end technologies, encompassing the likes of `Node.js`, `Python`, `React`, and various database systems. But I'm not just about code, I possess a profound understanding of `DevSecOps`, `Networking`, and `CyberSecurity`. Currently I'm pursing PG in Cybersecurity, eager to broaden my horizons and contribute to the ever-evolving world of digital security. I hold a strong belief in the importance of code quality and am deeply passionate about contributing to open-source projects, promoting collaborative development within the community.

## Journey üöÄ

My career in software development began at [Technorio Inc.](https://technorio.com/), a company co-founded by my college friends. As a core team member, I worked as a Team Lead Software Engineer, actively contributing to web application projects, leading architectural decision-making, and mentoring fellow developers. Then, my journey led me to DoranSoft Pvt. Ltd. as a Full Stack Developer, where I leveraged technologies like `Laravel Framework`, `Vue.js`, `jQuery`, and `Postgres` for web application development.

At [Leapfrog Technology, Inc.](https://www.lftechnology.com/) to [Laudio](https://www.laudio.com/), I wore multiple hats. I started as a Trainee at Leapfrog Technology, where I built a strong foundation in UI/UX front-end design and coding practices in Javascript. I then embarked on an exciting journey as a Software Engineer at a project called Laudio, where I familiarized myself with microservices architecture, integrated automated CI processes in development workflow and continued building a Web application based on React and Node.js. Subsequently, I progressed to a Senior Software Engineer, leading a team and contributing to system design, research and implementation.

Seeking further expertise, I joined for a Postgraduate Degree in Cybersecurity, where I'm continuously enhancing my knowledge in this critical field of IT.

## Certifications üéØ

To stay at the forefront of cybersecurity, I've earned several certifications, including:
