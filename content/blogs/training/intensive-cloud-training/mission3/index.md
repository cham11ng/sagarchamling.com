## Mission Introduction

In this mission, we'll perform the database migration and files migration in Google Cloud SQL and AWS S3 respectively. After the migration process is done, we successfully finished all the mission from the trainings. Then we start to deprovision and delete all the resources to avoid charges in Cloud Services.

### Inside

- We migrate the SQL dump file data to Google Cloud SQL using Google Cloud Shell.
- Then, we migrate the PDF files to S3 Bucket using AWS CloudShell.
- Deprovision and delete all resource using Terraform.
